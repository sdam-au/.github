# Social Dynamics in the Ancient Mediterranean Project 👋

We are a research group based at Aarhus University, Denmark, active in 2019-2022 (funded by the Aarhus University Research Foundation AUFF). 
We study the development of past societies of the ancient Mediterranean by analysing the available longitudinal datasets, such as Greek and Latin inscriptions, 
demographic data, transportational networks and other material proxies for past human activity. In accordance with FAIR data and Open Science principles, we publish all our
outputs and related scripts under CC-BY-SA 4.0 License so that other people can expand and build on our work. You can follow us on Twitter at
